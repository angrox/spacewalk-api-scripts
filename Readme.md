spacewalk-api-scripts - fuckit edition
=====================

What is this?
-------------
My attempt to provide some (non-)error handling and being not funny at the same time.
Implemented with #fuckitpy giving some double fucks, but not (yet) completely fucked.

Just don't use it if you don't know what you are doing.

This release is dedicated to the awesome @angrox! 


SRSLY! What is this!?
-------------
These are a few scripts which utilize the spacewalk api to perform various tasks. 
For we all have (mostly) the same problems or requirements I will publish all scripts
I wrote to perform recurring or annoying tasks. 


Scripts
-------
* spacewalk-rhn-sync -- Sync packages from the Red Hat Network and pushes it to the spacewalk server. Uses mrepo! 
* spacewalk-orgclone-channel -- Clones a channel and its errata to a new channel. This works even if the channel is shared from another organization.
* spacewalk-create-yumrepo -- Creates a yum repository out of an spacewalk channel
* spacewalk-compare-packages -- Compares packages of an host for a different channel to check for updates 
* spacewalk-clone-errata -- Clones errata from one channel to another
* spacewalk-remove-old-packages -- Deletes packages without channel OR outdated packages from one channel
* spacewalk-schedule-scriptrun -- Schedules a remote command for one client
* uln-clone-errata -- Fetches errata information for oracles "unbreakable" red hat clone and pushes it into spacewalk
   -- Update 20130618: It seems this script is outdated - ULN errata comes with an XML file within the repo and spacewalk-repo-sync honors that file
* spacewalk-generate-reinstall-key -- Generates a reinstall activation key for a given system
